class DeepMixtureOfExpertsModel(_CtrModel):
    r"""Model class of Deep Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model.

    Deep Mixture-of-Experts is purposed by David Eigen et at at 2013, which is to combine 
    outputs of several `expert` models, each of which specializes in a different part of input 
    space. To combine them, a gate, which is a stack of linear and softmax, will be trained 
    for weighing outputs of expert before return.
