    r"""Layer class of Starspace.
    
    Starpspace by Ledell Wu et al, 2017 is proposed by Facebook in 2017. 

    It was implemented in C++ originally for a general purpose to embed different kinds of 
    relations between different pairs, like (word, tag), (user-group) etc. Starspace is 
    calculated in the following way: 

    #. calculate similarity between context and positive samples or negative samples 
    
    #. calculate margin ranking loss between similarity of positive samples and those of negative 
    samples
